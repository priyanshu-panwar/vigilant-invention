"""
- A task is a wrapper of a coroutine that schedules the coroutine to run on the event loop as soon as possible.
- The scheduling and execution occur in a non-blocking manner. In other words, you can create a task and execute other code instantly while the task is running.
- Notice that the task is different from the await keyword that blocks the entire coroutine until the operation completes with a result.
- Itâ€™s important that you can create multiple tasks and schedule them to run instantly on the event loop at the same time.
- To create a task, you pass a coroutine to the create_task() function of the asyncio package. The create_task() function returns a Task object.
